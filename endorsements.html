      <h2>From Customers/Teammates</h2>
      <blockquote>
        I have worked with Caleb both as a Junkluggers customer and a co-worker at Venture. His ability to quickly grasp complex concepts and then develop and implement processes around them is truly a gift. In his position at Venture his
        leadership skills were critical as he rallied and revitalized a discouraged team, guiding them to meet an on-time launch. He will be a consistent high contributor to any company lucky enough to have him.
